# FPGA_Wave_Generator
The Simulation Single Photon Detector Based On FPGA

For the different application of single photon detectors, by using MATLAB in software simulation modeling and FPGA in
hardware simulation, according to the performance of single photon detectors, adjust the output signals generated by FPGA
waveform.

I have offered the verilog and matlab source code. You can add it to your Quartus or Vivado project.

It requires Matlab/Quartus or Vivado

If you can see my project I hope you it can help you in your project.
